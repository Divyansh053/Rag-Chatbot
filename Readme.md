# 🤖 Gemini RAG Chatbot

This is a full-stack, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot application. It uses a Python FastAPI backend to connect to a vector database and the Google Gemini API, and a React frontend to provide a user-friendly chat interface.

The application can ingest PDF documents, store their content in a knowledge base, and answer user questions based on the ingested information, providing accurate and context-aware responses.

## ✨ Features

  * **Document Upload**: Ingest knowledge from PDF files directly through the API.
  * **Vectorized Knowledge Base**: Uses ChromaDB to store and efficiently search through document embeddings.
  * **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Leverages Google Gemini to generate accurate answers based on retrieved context from the knowledge base.
  * **Modern Tech Stack**: Built with a high-performance FastAPI backend and a responsive React frontend.
  * **RESTful API**: A well-defined API for managing the knowledge base and interacting with the chatbot.
  * **Ready for Deployment**: Configured for easy, one-click deployment on Vercel.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

  * **Backend**:
      * Python 3.11+
      * FastAPI (for the web server)
      * Uvicorn (as the ASGI server)
      * Google Generative AI (for embeddings and chat generation)
      * ChromaDB (as the local vector store)
      * PyMuPDF (for PDF text extraction)
  * **Frontend**:
      * React.js
      * Axios (for API requests)
      * Tailwind CSS (for styling)

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

  * Python 3.11 or later
  * Node.js and npm
  * A Google Gemini API Key

### 1\. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd <your-project-folder>
```

### 2\. Backend Setup

First, set up and run the Python backend server.

```bash
# Navigate to the backend directory
cd Chatbot

# Create and activate a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

# Install the required Python packages
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Create the .env file
# Create a new file named .env in the /Chatbot directory and add your API key:
# GOOGLE_API_KEY="your_google_gemini_api_key_here"

# Start the backend server
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The backend API will now be running on **`http://127.0.0.1:8000`**.

### 3\. Frontend Setup

Open a **new terminal** and follow these steps to run the React frontend.

```bash
# Navigate to the frontend directory
cd Frontend

# Install the required Node.js packages
npm install

# Start the frontend development server
npm start
```

The frontend application will now be running on **`http://localhost:3000`**.

## ☁️ Deployment

This project is pre-configured for deployment on **Vercel**.

1.  **Push to GitHub**: Make sure your code is pushed to a GitHub repository.
2.  **Import to Vercel**: Import the repository on the Vercel dashboard.
3.  **Add Environment Variables**: In the Vercel project settings, add your `GOOGLE_API_KEY` as an environment variable.
4.  **Deploy**: Vercel will automatically use the `vercel.json` and `.vercelignore` files to build and deploy both the frontend and backend.
